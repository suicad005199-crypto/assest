# AI Sports Prediction System

An AI-powered multi-agent system for sports betting analysis.

---

## Features

- Multi-agent AI prediction system
- Football & Basketball support
- Win probability estimation
- Expected Value (EV) calculation
- Risk assessment engine
- Betting recommendation system
- Frontend visualization

---

## System Design

This project uses a modular AI architecture:

Data Analyst → Tactical Analyst → Statistical Model → Sentiment Analyst → Risk Manager → Decision Engine

---

## Core Principle

This system does NOT aim for perfect prediction.

It aims to:

- Identify value bets
- Maintain positive EV
- Achieve long-term ROI > 5%

---

## Tech Stack

Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Backend (planned):
- Python
- FastAPI

AI:
- GPT / Claude / Gemini (multi-agent reasoning)

Database (planned):
- PostgreSQL

## Expected Output

Example:

```json
{
  "match": "Team A vs Team B",
  "home_win_probability": 0.58,
  "draw_probability": 0.22,
  "away_win_probability": 0.20,
  "predicted_score": "2-1",
  "ev": 0.12,
  "risk": "LOW",
  "confidence": "A",
  "recommendation": "BET"
}
```

## How It Works

1. Input match data
2. Each AI agent analyzes independently
3. Decision Engine aggregates results
4. EV is calculated
5. Final recommendation is generated

---

## Future Improvements

- Real-time odds integration
- Automated scraping system
- Machine learning model (XGBoost / LightGBM)
- Backtesting engine
- Telegram / Discord alerts
- Portfolio tracking system

---

## Goal

Build a system that consistently identifies positive expected value opportunities in sports betting markets.
